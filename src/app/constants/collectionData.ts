        description: "Welcome To the Gridiron of the Damned!   Huge hulking bodies throw themselves at each other, while a tiny lithe body runs between them for the goal!  No, it&rsquo;s not a game of football, it&rsquo;s Sena Kobayakawa trying to evade the monstrous Ha-Ha brothers down the halls of Deimon High School!  But wait!  Sena&rsquo;s incredible skills at not getting caught have been spotted by the devilish (possibly actually demonic) captain of the school&rsquo;s embryonic American style football team, and when Sena asks to be the teams manager, he gets  thrust onto the field as a running back instead!  But there are two BIG catches: first, to keep the identity of their new &ldquo;star&rdquo; player an absolute secret, Yoichi makes Sena wear an opaque visor on his helmet and gives him the alias of &ldquo;Eyeshield 21.&rdquo;  And the second catch?  Well, in order to hit his fastest &ldquo;speed of light&rdquo; running mode, Sena usually has to be absolutely terrified. Not that THAT will be a problem with the monstrous players that he&rsquo;ll soon find himself running from!  The insanity hits the streets when the feet meet the cleats in EYESHIELD 21! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
